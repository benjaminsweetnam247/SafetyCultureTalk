              Hi I'm Ben, you probably have seen me around a bit in the last two
              weeks. I've been here at SafetyCulture doing an Internship as part
              of my experience learning software testing with tested.

            <aside class="notes">
              I would like to thank everyone from safety culture for their
              kindness and hospitality. Two weeks is not alot of time to spend
              with a team and it's flown by. One thing I'm taking from this
              experience is that time waits for no one and you need to be
              organised and help each other forward otherwise your deadlines are
              going to come, go and leave you behind.

              My Expectations for these two weeks. So I had the idea I would be
              working with an Experienced QA and be able to learn how they work
              and what they do differntly that helps their team. :SLIDE: Another
              thought I had was that I wouldn't be able to find anything. an
              asumption that was linked to the first point and completely wrong

              Morning Standups are not new to me but this method of breaking
              down the tasks and guessing a number on them was quite new to me.
              I found it interesting in that it adjust to the team and even in
              the two weeks I could see myself getting better at estimating what
              number a task should be. though If I'm honest it was usually based
              on how passionatly a team member described the difficulty with
              that ticket. at the time of writting this I hadn't done a
              retrospective yet.
